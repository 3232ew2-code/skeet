The SKEET Architecture: A Blueprint for a Modern Trading Platform
Introduction: What is SKEET and How Does It Work?
Imagine using a modern, AI-focused framework like SKEET to build an advanced, automated restaurant designed for the fast-paced world of financial trading. The menu would be your screen, the kitchen a powerful engine that could expand instantly to handle a thousand orders, the master chef an AI genius analyzing every ingredient, and fresh ingredients delivered from the market every millisecond. This guide will walk you through that architectural concept.
The goal of this document is to demystify the core components of a trading platform built on the SKEET framework. We will explore the four main areas of this conceptual "restaurant," showing how they would work together to create a powerful and intuitive trading tool. By the end, you'll understand the core concepts behind this modern architecture.
Here is a roadmap of what we will cover:
1. The Frontend: The dining room and menu where you would place your orders.
2. The Backend: The automated kitchen designed to do all the heavy lifting.
3. AI Integration: The master chef providing expert insights.
4. Real-Time Analytics: The live ingredient delivery system that would fuel everything.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The Frontend: Your Control Center
The frontend is everything a user would see and interact with on their screen. Think of it as the cockpit of a jet or the dining room of our restaurant—it's where all the controls, information, and menus would be presented. Its primary job is to provide a clear, responsive, and intuitive way to command the powerful engine running behind the scenes.
Key Features
Feature
What It Means For You
Responsive Design (React/React Native)
This architecture is designed to provide a seamless, consistent experience whether you are on a desktop computer, a tablet, or a smartphone.
Interactive Data Visualization
Complex market data is turned into clear, interactive charts and dashboards, helping you spot trends easily.
Robust State Management
The trading information and market data you see are always updated in real-time, without lag or delay.

The use of React for the web and React Native for mobile apps, which share the same core technology, allows for a high-quality experience on every device. This makes development faster and more consistent than building three separate platforms from scratch. In short, the frontend provides an intuitive gateway to the platform's powerful engine.
Now that we've seen the controls in the cockpit, let's look at the powerful engine that makes it fly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The Backend: The Engine Room
The backend is the engine room of the platform—the powerful kitchen that would work tirelessly behind the scenes to execute your commands. It's responsible for all the heavy lifting, from processing trades to managing data. A platform built on SKEET would have its backend built on a modern concept called a "serverless" framework, representing a major shift away from the traditional approach of maintaining expensive, always-on servers.
Demystifying "Serverless"
Imagine a traditional restaurant kitchen with a fixed number of chefs. On a slow night, many are idle, but during a dinner rush, they get overwhelmed. This is inefficient.
A serverless framework is like an on-demand, automated kitchen that instantly scales its staff and resources up or down based on how many orders are coming in. If one order arrives, one robot chef appears to cook it. If a thousand orders arrive, a thousand robot chefs instantly appear. This ensures the system is always perfectly staffed, incredibly efficient, and never slows down, no matter how busy the market gets.
Core Backend Attributes
• Automatic Scaling The platform would automatically handle sudden rushes of activity, like those during volatile market events. This ensures the platform never slows down or crashes when you need it most.
• Domain-Driven Design (DDD) This means the system is neatly organized into independent modules, like different stations in a kitchen (grill, prep, pastry, etc.). This approach, known in software engineering as Domain-Driven Design (DDD), is crucial for complex systems like trading platforms because it allows different teams to work on separate components (like order management or risk analysis) without breaking the entire system.
• Cloud Functions These are the specialized "robot chefs" from our serverless kitchen analogy. Each Cloud Function is a tiny, independent program that does one specific task perfectly (e.g., retrieving a stock price, authenticating a user). By breaking the work into thousands of these specialists, the system becomes incredibly efficient, fast, and easy to update.
The serverless backend provides the raw power, speed, and reliability that drives the entire platform. While the backend provides the raw power, the platform's real intelligence comes from its integrated AI.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. AI Integration: Your Expert Co-Pilot
In this model, Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration would act as the "master chef" or "expert co-pilot" of the platform. Its job is to analyze vast amounts of information—far more than a human could—to provide intelligent insights, identify opportunities, and automate complex tasks, helping you make more informed decisions.
Key AI Capabilities
1. Pre-Trained Model Integration (ChatGPT, Vertex AI) The SKEET framework is designed to connect to powerful, world-class AI models. The benefit for you is that the platform could perform advanced tasks like analyzing the sentiment of market news (is it positive or negative?) or even answering your questions about market conditions in natural, conversational language.
2. Automated Code Generation (Prisma) This is a tool like Prisma, an advanced Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), which allows developers to define the platform's data structures using simple, clear language. The tool then automatically writes the complex code needed to manage that data. For you, this means new features that rely on data—like new analysis tools or portfolio views—can be built faster and more reliably.
AI vs. Traditional Comparison
Traditional Platform
SKEET Platform
Requires manual data analysis and expertise
Offers AI-driven insights and sentiment analysis.
Slow development of new analytical tools
Rapidly develops new features using automated tools.

The AI acts as an intelligent layer that enhances your decision-making and keeps the platform on the cutting edge. But even the smartest co-pilot is useless without real-time information from its sensors; this is where the analytics engine comes in.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Real-Time Analytics: The Platform's Nervous System
In older systems, data was often processed in slow, overnight batches. The engine at the heart of a modern SKEET-like architecture is built for the exact opposite: real-time analytics. This engine is the platform's central nervous system or, in our restaurant analogy, its live ingredient delivery system. Its purpose is to ingest, process, and deliver massive amounts of market data from countless sources to all parts of the platform—instantly.
The Data Journey
The flow of data through this architecture is a high-speed, three-step journey built for the demands of modern trading.
1. Data Capture The system would constantly ingest data from dozens of sources, including live market feeds, news wires, and user trade orders.
2. Streaming Data Processing As soon as data arrives, it would be sorted, analyzed, and processed in real-time. Unlike older systems, this architecture analyzes data as it streams in, moment by moment.
3. Delivery The processed data and insights would be delivered instantly to your dashboard (the frontend) and the AI (your co-pilot) so that every decision is based on the most up-to-the-second information available.
In trading, a delay of even a millisecond can be the difference between profit and loss. SKEET's architecture is built for this high-speed environment.
Data Storage Explained
To manage all this information, the architecture uses different types of data storage, much like a library has different sections for different needs.
• Cloud SQL: This is like the library's official member database—perfectly organized (structured data) for essential, frequent lookups.
• Firestore: This is the quick-reference desk, designed for the extreme speed (fast, NoSQL operations) needed to keep the application running smoothly.
• BigQuery: This is the vast research archive, a data warehouse built to analyze massive amounts of historical data for deep market research.
The real-time analytics engine is the crucial component that ensures the entire platform—from your dashboard to the AI—is operating with the freshest, most accurate information possible.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Putting It All Together: From Click to Trade
To understand how these components would work together, imagine clicking the 'Buy' button in a platform built on this architecture.
That single click on the Frontend would send a signal to the Backend's serverless functions—the on-demand "robot chefs." The Real-Time Analytics engine would instantly supply the latest price data to ensure accuracy, while the AI might simultaneously analyze the trade against current market sentiment. All of this would happen in a fraction of a second, allowing your order to be processed with maximum speed and intelligence.
Final Takeaway
Ultimately, an architecture like SKEET's works behind the scenes to make a complex, high-speed activity like trading feel simple, responsive, and intelligent.
