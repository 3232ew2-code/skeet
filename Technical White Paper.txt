SKEET: A Technical White Paper on a Proposed Next-Generation Serverless Trading Platform
1.0 Introduction: Redefining Trading in the Digital Age
Modern financial markets operate at a velocity and scale that continuously challenges the limits of legacy infrastructure. The relentless torrent of data, coupled with unprecedented market volatility, places immense pressure on trading platforms that were not designed for the cloud-native era. Traditional monolithic systems often struggle with scalability, incur high operational costs, and lack the agility required to integrate cutting-edge artificial intelligence, leaving firms at a significant competitive disadvantage.
This white paper proposes SKEET, a visionary architectural blueprint for a next-generation, multi-user trading automation and analytics platform, engineered from the ground up to overcome these limitations. This document outlines a powerful application of the core principles found in the 'Skeet' serverless framework—a proven, lightweight system for AI-driven app development—to the highly demanding domain of financial trading. By adapting this modern, cloud-native foundation, the proposed SKEET platform represents a paradigm shift in how trading systems can be designed, deployed, and operated.
The primary objective of this document is to provide technical stakeholders, investors, and decision-makers with a comprehensive analysis of the proposed SKEET platform. We will dissect its serverless, AI-native architecture, detail its multi-layered system design, evaluate a strategic business model, and outline its disruptive market potential.
This analysis will proceed by first examining the core architectural philosophy that would underpin the platform. We will then take a deep dive into each proposed layer of the system, from the user-facing presentation layer to the data persistence layer. Following the technical review, we will explore the platform's potential market strategy and competitive positioning before concluding with a look at its future roadmap and the compelling case for adopting this new paradigm.
2.0 The Architectural Philosophy: Serverless, AI-Native, and Event-Driven
The strategic value of a trading platform is intrinsically linked to its core architectural philosophy. The proposed design for SKEET would not be an incremental improvement on existing models but a fundamental paradigm shift away from traditional, rigid monolithic systems. This new approach would be built on three interconnected pillars that collectively deliver unprecedented agility, scalability, and intelligence.
Serverless-First: The platform would strategically leverage a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model. In the volatile and unpredictable environment of financial trading, the ability to automatically scale compute resources in response to market activity is paramount. This serverless approach would eliminate the need for managing persistent servers, drastically reducing operational overhead and infrastructure costs. Resources would be provisioned on-demand, ensuring that costs are directly aligned with usage—a critical advantage during periods of fluctuating trading volumes.
AI-Native Integration: Unlike legacy platforms where artificial intelligence is often a bolted-on feature, SKEET would be engineered to be AI-native. The architecture would be designed from the ground up for the seamless integration of sophisticated AI and Machine Learning (ML) services, such as ChatGPT for sentiment analysis or Vertex AI for predictive analytics. This native integration would move AI from the periphery to the core of the platform's functionality, enabling powerful, real-time decision support and automation.
Event-Driven Communication: SKEET would employ a decoupled, event-driven model to manage the flow of information. In trading, where milliseconds matter, this architecture would ensure high-throughput, low-latency performance. By treating market data, user orders, and analytical triggers as discrete events, the system could process massive volumes of information in parallel. This not only enhances performance but also enables robust real-time analytics and provides the resilience needed for mission-critical operations.
Together, these three pillars form a cohesive architectural vision that directly addresses the core challenges of modern trading. We will now explore how this philosophy could be implemented across the specific layers of the proposed SKEET system.
3.0 SKEET System Architecture: A Multi-Layered Deep Dive
This section presents the technical core of the proposed SKEET platform. By dissecting each architectural layer—from the user interface where traders interact with the market, to the compute and intelligence layers where logic is executed, down to the persistence layer where data is stored—we will demonstrate how SKEET’s design philosophy would translate into superior performance, functionality, and business value.
3.1 The Presentation Layer: Real-Time Frontend & User Experience
The frontend architecture would be engineered to deliver a responsive, intuitive, and unified user experience across web and mobile devices. A key design principle would be the adoption of a micro frontend architecture, which aligns perfectly with the backend's modularity. This approach would allow different features of the user interface—such as charting, order management, and analytics dashboards—to be developed, tested, and deployed independently by separate teams. Leveraging modern frameworks like React and React Native within this architecture would ensure traders have seamless access to critical market data and tools, regardless of their location or device.
The key capabilities of the proposed presentation layer would directly benefit the trader in several ways:
Responsive & Interactive Design: The architecture would be optimized to handle high-frequency data streams, enabling real-time charting, interactive dashboards, and instantaneous updates to market data feeds. This ensures traders can react to market movements without delay.
Advanced State Management: Sophisticated state management patterns would be employed to maintain data consistency across the entire user interface. When a position is updated or a market alert is triggered, that change would be instantly reflected everywhere, eliminating confusion and ensuring data integrity.
Dynamic Data Visualization: The platform would excel at transforming raw, complex market data into clear, actionable insights. Advanced data visualization libraries would render interactive charts and custom-built dashboards that help users identify trends, spot opportunities, and manage risk effectively.
3.2 The Compute Layer: Serverless Backend & Business Logic
The backend would serve as the engine of the SKEET platform, built on a powerful serverless framework using Typescript and deployed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This FaaS model would provide the foundation for the platform’s scalability and operational efficiency.
A key strategic choice in the backend design is its adherence to Domain-Driven Design (DDD). By partitioning complex business logic into distinct, domain-specific microservices, the platform would achieve a high degree of modularity. For high-performance, low-latency communication between these services, the architecture would leverage modern frameworks like gRPC. This combination of DDD and gRPC would allow development teams to build, test, deploy, and scale individual services—such as order management, risk analysis, or user authentication—independently, dramatically accelerating the development lifecycle and enhancing system resilience.
The developer experience would be further streamlined by the SKEET Command-Line Interface (CLI). This powerful tool would enable developers to rapidly scaffold new functions, automate configuration, and maintain a logical project structure, reducing time-to-market for new features.
3.3 The Intelligence Layer: Integrated AI & Analytics Engine
SKEET's proposed native AI integration would be a core differentiator. The platform would dramatically simplify the deployment of pre-trained models from leading services like ChatGPT and Vertex AI. Developers could integrate sophisticated capabilities—such as real-time news sentiment analysis or market trend prediction—with simple API configurations, making advanced AI accessible without requiring deep machine learning expertise.
This intelligence layer would work in synergy with the backend. The use of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools like Prisma would allow developers to define database schemas in natural language, which the system could then use to automatically generate the necessary code and database migrations. This automation would streamline data management and accelerate AI training workflows.
Furthermore, SKEET’s real-time analytics capabilities would be designed for high-performance data streaming, drawing parallels to industry-leading platforms like Striim. By leveraging persisted streams, the architecture would support robust, decoupled, and asynchronous processing. This is critical for creating a resilient analytics engine that can handle massive event volumes without data loss, enabling traders to make timely, data-driven decisions.
3.4 The Persistence Layer: A Proposed Multi-Modal Data Strategy
To manage the diverse data requirements of a modern trading platform, SKEET would employ a multi-tiered data storage strategy.
