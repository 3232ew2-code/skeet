Conceptual Architecture Blueprint: The SKEET Trading Platform

This document presents a conceptual architecture for SKEET, an innovative system envisioned as a multi-user trading automation and analytics platform. The design represents a strategic departure from traditional, monolithic financial systems, proposing a more agile, intelligent, and scalable model. This analysis provides a deep-dive into a proposed serverless architecture, multi-tiered data model, and core integrations, based on extrapolations from the Skeet AI application framework [3]. The objective is to dissect the technological components and strategic advantages of this conceptual SKEET architecture, offering a clear blueprint of its capabilities and future potential in the FinTech landscape.

Core Backend Architecture: A Serverless, Domain-Driven Model

The strategic decision to base the SKEET platform on a serverless, domain-driven architecture would be fundamental to its value proposition. This modern approach would provide the critical agility required for a FinTech platform, enabling effortless scalability to handle volatile market conditions and rapid deployment cycles that accelerate time-to-market for new features. The proposed backend is designed for high performance, modularity, and a radically improved total cost of ownership.

The key attributes of SKEET's proposed backend framework would be as follows:

Foundation: The architecture is founded on Typescript and a rigorous function-as-a-service (FaaS) model, designed to run on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This would provide a robust, high-performance foundation for all backend operations.
Design Principle: Adherence to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is not merely a technical choice; it is a strategic imperative. In a financial platform, this ensures that complex business logic for domains like trade execution, risk management, and compliance reporting remain logically isolated. This isolation prevents code entanglement, reduces regression risk, and allows specialist teams to iterate on business-critical features without disrupting the entire system.
Execution Model: All backend operations would be encapsulated into discrete, serverless Cloud Functions. This event-triggered model would eliminate the need for persistent servers, reducing operational overhead and allowing the system to respond dynamically to incoming requests and market events.
Development Efficiency: A command-line interface (CLI) would be used to scaffold new functions and organize project directories into logical units. This approach streamlines the development workflow, maximizing engineering velocity by allowing teams to rapidly build, test, and deploy new capabilities.

A typical backend trading operation would follow a clear, orchestrated flow, broken down into the following steps:

Request Initiation: A request originates from the user frontend and is routed via a load balancer to the appropriate serverless function.
Data Retrieval: A dedicated data retrieval function pulls necessary market and account information from the multi-tiered data storage.
Signal Processing: This data is then passed to a trading signal processing function, which applies algorithmic logic to determine a course of action.
Order Execution: If a trade is warranted, an order execution function securely transmits the order to the relevant exchange via an API.
State Update: The process culminates with a real-time market data update, which is persisted and reflected back on the user's dashboard.

This efficient, serverless process flow must be supported by a sophisticated data infrastructure, which is the critical underpinning for managing the high volume and velocity of financial data.

Data Modeling and Real-Time Analytics Infrastructure

For any modern trading platform, the ability to manage and analyze massive volumes of high-frequency data in real time is not just a feature—it is the core engine of competitive advantage. Timely and accurate decision-making depends entirely on a robust data infrastructure. SKEET's proposed architecture would address this with a multi-tiered storage strategy and an event-driven model for stream processing.

Multi-Tiered Data Storage

A proposed data strategy would involve a sophisticated, multi-tiered data storage solution to handle diverse data types and access patterns efficiently. This ensures that data is stored in the most appropriate system for its intended use, from transactional records to large-scale historical analysis.

Cloud SQL: Would serve as the primary repository for structured data, such as user accounts, trade histories, and transactional records that require strong consistency and relational integrity.
Firestore: Would be used for fast, NoSQL operations where schema flexibility and low-latency reads/writes are paramount. This is ideal for managing application state, user configurations, and real-time market data snapshots.
BigQuery: Would function as the platform's large-scale data warehouse. It would be optimized for analyzing massive historical datasets, allowing for complex queries to uncover long-term market trends, backtest trading strategies, and generate deep analytical insights.

Real-Time Stream Processing

The platform’s real-time analytics capabilities would be powered by an event-driven architecture, inspired by high-performance streaming platforms like Striim [1]. This model is essential for processing continuous streams of market data with minimal delay. By decoupling application logic from data persistence, the system could process events asynchronously, ensuring high throughput and low latency even during periods of extreme market volatility. This architecture allows trading signals to be generated and acted upon in near real time, providing a critical edge in fast-paced markets.

This powerful data infrastructure is designed to be leveraged by a suite of tightly integrated AI, cloud, and frontend services.

Key System Integrations: AI, Cloud, and Frontend

The strategic value of the SKEET concept would be amplified by its deep integration with best-in-class AI, cloud, and frontend technologies. These integrations would elevate the platform from a simple backend execution engine to a comprehensive and intelligent system capable of delivering predictive insights and a seamless user experience.

The platform's approach to AI and cloud service integration marks a significant departure from traditional, more cumbersome methods. SKEET would be designed to leverage cloud-native services and pre-trained AI models to accelerate development and enhance functionality, as detailed below.

Aspect	Traditional Approach	SKEET Approach AI Model Deployment	Requires in-depth machine learning expertise.	Proposes simple, CLI-driven API integration with leading AI services like ChatGPT and Vertex AI. Code Generation	Manual database schema creation.	Would utilize advanced tools like Prisma to automatically generate database models and migration files. Real-Time Analytics	Batch processing.	Engineered for high-throughput, low-latency event processing inspired by platforms like Striim [1]. Cloud Service Utilization	Dedicated server management.	Would be built entirely on serverless functions with autoscaling on GCP [3].

This allows for the rapid deployment of sophisticated models for tasks like real-time market sentiment analysis scraped from news feeds (via ChatGPT) or predictive analytics for asset price movements (via Vertex AI), transforming raw data into a direct competitive advantage.

On the frontend, the backend architecture is designed to serve modern, responsive applications built with frameworks like React and React Native. Robust state management patterns would be implemented to handle the constant flow of real-time updates for trading information, market data, and account balances. This ensures that the user interface remains fluid, interactive, and perfectly synchronized with the backend.

While these integrations define the platform's intelligence, their real-time orchestration depends entirely on a robust set of underlying API and event-driven communication protocols.

API and Event-Driven Communication Protocols

In a distributed system like the one proposed for SKEET, APIs and event-driven communication protocols are the connective tissue that binds the architecture together. They are critical for connecting to external services, such as exchanges and AI models, and for enabling the asynchronous, real-time data flow that is essential for modern trading operations.

APIs would serve as the primary interface for external connectivity. They would be used to transmit execution orders to a wide range of cryptocurrency and stock exchanges, ensuring reliable and secure communication with market venues. Furthermore, APIs are instrumental in integrating the platform with pre-trained AI models, such as ChatGPT for natural language processing or Vertex AI for predictive analytics. This allows SKEET to offload complex computational tasks to specialized services, enriching its analytical capabilities without adding complexity to the core codebase.

Internally, the platform would rely on an event-driven model as its primary method of communication. By using persisted streams, SKEET facilitates a decoupled architecture where different microservices or functions can communicate asynchronously. For example, a data ingestion service can publish new market data to a stream, and multiple downstream services—such as a real-time analytics module, a trade signal generator, and a historical data archiver—can all subscribe and react to these events independently. This model is essential for building a resilient and scalable system that can process high volumes of data in real time, which is a non-negotiable requirement in volatile trading environments.

This technical implementation provides the foundation for what could be a significant strategic advantage in the marketplace.

Strategic Analysis and Future Architectural Roadmap

Beyond its technical implementation, the true value of SKEET's proposed architecture lies in its distinct competitive advantages and its clear potential for future evolution. By leveraging a modern, cloud-native stack, the platform would be positioned to outperform traditional systems in key areas while offering a solid foundation for future growth and innovation.
