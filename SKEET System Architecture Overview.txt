That is an insightful query, asking to focus on the technical core of the SKEET platform. Drawing on the specific research documents provided, we can construct a detailed overview of the proposed system architecture, noting that the analysis is based on extrapolating the capabilities of the "Skeet framework" (a serverless framework for AI-driven app development) onto the context of a multi-user trading platform.
The SKEET System Architecture Overview positions the platform as a modular and layered system designed to meet complex trading requirements while ensuring development accessibility and scalability.
Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the System Architecture Overview as detailed in the sources:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Architectural Foundation and Context
The primary goal of the research is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the complete system architecture and business concept behind SKEET, which is identified as a multi-user trading automation and analytics platform.
It is critical to note that the analysis largely adapts and extrapolates insights from the available documentation on the "Skeet framework," a lightweight serverless framework for AI-driven app development, to articulate the architecture of the envisioned trading platform.
The overall architecture is modular and layered, allowing it to handle complex trading needs effectively while maintaining an environment that is both accessible and scalable.
2. Frontend Architecture
The frontend serves as the user-facing interface, intended to cater to both novice traders and experienced financial professionals.
• Technology Stack: The design leverages modern JavaScript frameworks, particularly React and React Native, to achieve rapid responsiveness, seamless interaction, and compatibility across various devices.
• Design Focus: It utilizes a responsive design approach to dynamically adjust layout and functionality across desktops, tablets, and smartphones, ensuring a unified user experience.
• Real-Time Data Handling: The architecture implements robust state management patterns to handle real-time updates for critical data such as trading information, market data, and user transactions.
• Data Visualization: It incorporates libraries capable of rendering high-frequency data visualizations and custom-built dashboards. This focuses on interactivity and dynamic charts, highlighting market trends and trading signals in real time.
3. Backend and Serverless Functions
The backbone of the SKEET platform is its serverless framework, which ensures rapid deployment and effortless scalability—features essential for handling volatile trading environments.
• Technology and Model: The backend is built using Typescript and employs a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model, primarily utilizing cloud providers like Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
• Domain-Driven Architecture: The platform follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, partitioning business logic into domain-specific modules that can be independently deployed, tested, and scaled.
• Serverless Operations: Backend operations are handled by discrete Cloud Functions. For example, a single function might retrieve market data, apply algorithmic logic, and transmit execution orders to connected exchanges, all without relying on a persistent server.
• Scalability: The serverless infrastructure provides automatic scaling to dynamically adjust resources based on load, crucial during periods of heightened market volatility.
• Development Tools: Developers benefit from a CLI (command-line interface) for rapidly scaffolding new functions, which generates configuration files and organizes directories logically.
4. Integration of AI and Cloud Services
A key differentiating feature of SKEET is its integrated support for AI-driven functionalities, which are intended to empower the platform to automate decisions, analyze market trends, and generate predictive insights.
• AI Model Integration: SKEET includes built-in libraries that connect with popular AI services such as ChatGPT and Vertex AI, supporting the deployment of pre-trained models for tasks like sentiment analysis and predictive analytics.
• Cloud Infrastructure: GCP is the primary cloud platform, offering services like Cloud SQL, Firestore, and BigQuery for comprehensive data storage and analytics.
• Automated Code Generation: The system uses advanced ORMs like Prisma to allow developers to define database schemas in natural language, leading to the automated generation of necessary migrations and model files.
• Real-Time Analytics Integration: The system integrates mechanisms for real-time data capture, leveraging modern data structures and query optimization techniques to offer high-throughput, low-latency event processing—a crucial feature for timely trading decisions.
5. Data Management and Real-Time Analytics
Given that immediate access and interpretation of large data volumes are critical in trading, SKEET utilizes a sophisticated data management strategy.
• Multi-Tiered Storage: The system employs a combination of storage solutions:
    ◦ Cloud SQL for structured data.
    ◦ Firestore for fast, NoSQL operations.
    ◦ BigQuery for large-scale data warehousing and historical analysis.
• Streaming Processing: SKEET adapts methodologies from high-performance data streaming platforms (like Striim) to enable the real-time ingestion and analysis of market data.
• Event-Driven Architecture: At its core, the system utilizes an event-driven model to decouple application logic from data persistence, which is essential for asynchronous processing and real-time analytics in volatile markets.
• Data Structures: Modern data structures, such as skip lists, are used to store windowed streaming data, facilitating rapid querying and analysis.
This comprehensive system architecture, with its cloud-native, serverless, and AI-integrated approach, sets SKEET apart from more traditional trading platforms, emphasizing enhanced scalability, real-time processing, and development efficiency.
